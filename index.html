      <p> The purpose of modern zoos is to entertain and educate the public, and also to preserve and protect various animal species and to provide a safe habitat for these animals.  Often the animals housed in zoos are animals that for various reasons cannot survive on their own in the wild.  This may be because they are physically disabled in some way, or because they did not learn proper survival skills while young due to interaction with humans or separation from their parent or herd.  This may also be because their natural habitat in the wild is endangered by the encroachment of humans or sometimes even due to changes in climate.    
      </p>
      <p> Modern zoos also provide opportunities for scientific research and education.  They provide an opportunity for many people to see and experience animals that they would otherwise not be able to see in person.  This can help promote conservation and concern for animals amongst the broader public. Zoo websites provide a wealth of educational information and activities for everyone from young children to college students and professional researchers.  Many of the zoos listed above have engaging activities available for elementary aged children, and provide group tours for schools and summer camps.  They also have more in-depth resources, such as conservation blogs for adults as well.  Some of the features of each of these zoos is provided below.

      <p> The Franklin Park Zoo is a large zoo located in Boston, MA.  While the zoo itself is large, most of the space is taken up as large habitats for the bigger animals.  The paths for visitors make up an easily walkable space, and are fully accessible for strollers and wheelchairs.  There is a very large playground for children, with a separate area for toddlers to play on smaller equipment.  Visitors can pet goats and get up close with other farm animals in the "Franklin Farm" exhibit, and can feed small colorful budgies in the "Aussie Aviary".  The "Butterfly Hollow" exhibit resembles a magical fairyland with lovely butterflys nestled around colorful fairy houses.  The Franklin Park Zoo is hosting the "Boston Lights: A Lantern Experience" special exhibit from July to mid-October of 2021.  Large, lighted sculptures are assembled throughout the zoo, and are lit each evening from 6pm to 9:30pm.  The Franklin Park Zoo is a really good venue for elementary aged kids who may need some active play to get out some extra energy because of the excellent playground.

      <p> The Animal Adventures Family Zoo and Rescue Center is an exotic animal rescue located in Bolton, MA.  Their mission is to give a home to unwanted and unable to be cared for animals while educating the public about these animals. They travel to many schools, libraries, colleges, and other functions to provide wildlife education, and accept unwanted pets and other animals.  If you are interested to learn more about exotic animals, but object to animals being intentionally removed from their natural habitat for entertainment purposes, Animal Adventures might be a good venue for you because of their focus on providing safe homes for rescued animals who are unable to return to the wild. This would also be an excellent venue for homeschool groups looking for educational enrichment in conservation and herpetology due to Animal Adventures "Zoo Academy".</p>
